-desc "This jet-black horn is the only thing that was left behind after Marcus single handedly slayed the demon-snake Ssisssuraaaaggg. Cold to the touch, when held the horn seems to vibrate slightly and emanate an inner warmth. While dark visions crossed your mind when you first laid hands on it, none have come to you sense. One can only hope that Melelm is in the afterlife working hard on writing an epic melody to spread the word of Marcus' bravery to the angels."
