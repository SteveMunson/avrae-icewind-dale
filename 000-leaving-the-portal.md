> As you each think upon your wishes you find the stars around you fading and the darkness of the abyssal void brightening. You blink your eyes several times to adjust to the new light and find yourselves standing in the main room with the large statue looming over you, it's damage repaired and its countenance taking on a striking similarity to your own. Each of you now sees the statue as your own ideal self, the hero of renown that your heart desired, a champion for whatever this unknown being may have been.

Take a few moments to describe the changes that you have undergone. Describe why you chose what you did and how you are different from the villager you once were.

> As you turn to leave the portal you pass through the room with with statues that killed one of the villagers. You notice that their body is gone, no longer pinned to door... and the statues are missing as well. You hear an unmistakable _scrape scrape_ sound coming from the corner of the room and notice that the 2 large statues have animated and are coming to attack you!

> "Those who wish to free the herald must die in this place!" a metallic gutteral scraping sound echoes from the helmet of one of the constructs as it hefts its weight in your direction.

> You feel the air slowly starting to get sucked from the room as a gust of wind slams the door towards the portal closed. The ground rumbles beneath your feet. There's no mistaking that this place is going to crash down around you, trapping you here for eternity!
