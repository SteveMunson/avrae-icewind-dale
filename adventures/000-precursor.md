For long years, you labored in the fields like all of the travelers in this land, sweat freezing to your flesh as the unforgiving winds of the dale killed your crops before they could find root.

This year’s harvest ended like all the rest, and autumn’s work has taken its tole on the village you and your families created. This place was supposed to be a refuge from the rest of Faerûn. A place where the secrets you've kept could not find the light. What was meant to be a new beginning for your families may instead be the end of all of you.

The town elder, Old Man Roberts, broke his back slipping on a patch of ice caught by his plow. His mule ran off, and it was several hours before anyone found him, frail, half frozen to death, fingers and toes as black as grapes.

When you visited his bedside at his end, he spoke in labored breaths of constellations that hadn’t been seen since he was a young lad. The last time the Empty Star had risen in the sky, it was more than fifty winters past, he said. Under the light of that strange star a portal had opened by the old stone mounds. He’d seen jewels in there and fine steel spears and enameled armor, but he’d run when the iron men had attacked. Now, old and dying, he wishes he’d taken the chance on a life of adventure. The Empty Star is once more rising, and someone with the courage could be more than just another peasant – if only they would take the chance Old Man Roberts hadn’t. The truth is that's why he had you all come to this place. That's why he lead you here all those years ago. He always hoped to find the courage to return and take the chance he never did before.

You are taking that chance. You stand before the monolithic rocks of the old stone mounds, under the dark light of a starry sky. The Empty Star is clear and bright above you. Three of the large stone blocks lean haphazardly together to form an upright rectangular portal about the size of a man. They seem to be placed directly beneath the star’s path. As the Empty Star ascends to its brightest point, its light catches in the portal, and a shimmering stonelined corridor is visible through the stones, but only from one side of the opening. Grasping your pitchfork with white knuckles, you step into the starlit portal which was not there before today, thoughts of the wealth and salvation you can bring to your dying village foremost on your mind.
If the twelve towns didn't recognize the village before, they certainly will when you return from this...

Icewind Dale has become trapped in a perpetual winter. Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen. Most dale residents blame Auril the Frostmaiden, the god of winter’s wrath. The shimmering aurora that weaves across the sky each night is said to be her doing—a potent spell that keeps the sun at bay.

Dalefolk live in a scattering of settlements known as Ten-Towns. The drop-off in caravans coming from the south and travel between settlements in this never-ending winter has left everyone feeling isolated. Although each town has resolved to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices of one kind or another, no respite from winter’s fury seems forthcoming. For adventurers such as yourselves, Ten-Towns is a place to test one’s mettle and, in the spirit of heroes who have come before, leave one’s mark on this frigid, blighted land. You come from a new town trying it's best to makes it mark on the Dale.

* We started with 30 villagers, striving against the brutal cold perpetual winter
* As luck would have it, another wandering survivor joined the town, and found comfort and solace with Sola, one of the village healers. The wanderer's name was Hagatha, and though she was sick and hungry, the village took her in
* In desperation and low on food, the villagers made the difficult decision to kill the domesticated animals they had on hand to supplement the food supplies
* Hagatha fell ill and risked losing her leg. While the village had the supplies necessary to cure Hagatha's infection and save her leg, through malice or desperation, the elders decided it would be best to not heal her, and to hold on to their supplies of medicine
* Hagatha's screaming kept the village up most nights as the frostbite and infection ate through her leg. The hurt and betrayal in her eyes stuck with each of you until she finally passed,  having starved to death and frozen. The winter was so cold and food so scarce that some in her household considered doing the unthinkable, but none of them caved into their most base of desires, even as they themselves died of starvation
* The winter took a dark turn for the worst. The long perpetual night shifted from constant snow to a roaring blizzard that kept up nonstop for many weeks. It was difficult to leave your homes to find the food and fuel necessary, and after some time the supplies began to dwindle. The hardest nights came when the whimpering from some of the beds in your households fell suddenly and abruptly quiet
* With each household suffering catastrophic losses and the storeroom supplies dwindling dangerously low, Old Man Roberts, the town elder, has called you to his bedside. Though he too is dying, he has one last mission for you that may just save the 10 survivors who are left...
